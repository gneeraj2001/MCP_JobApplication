# MCP Job Application Generator

A sophisticated application that uses AI agents to generate personalized job application materials. The system employs multiple specialized AI agents powered by GPT-4 to analyze job descriptions, parse resumes, and generate tailored application materials.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (React + Material-UI)
The application consists of a modern React frontend with the following key features:
- Resume file upload and parsing
- Job description and company information input
- Real-time application material generation
- Local storage for resume data persistence
- PDF and text file support
- Material-UI components for a polished user interface

### AI Agents
The system uses four specialized OpenAI GPT-4 agents:

1. **Context Agent** (`contextAgent.js`)
   - Analyzes job descriptions and company information
   - Extracts key requirements and qualifications
   - Identifies company culture and values
   - Matches candidate skills with job requirements

2. **Strategy Agent** (`strategyAgent.js`)
   - Develops tailored application approaches
   - Identifies key points to emphasize
   - Suggests specific examples and achievements
   - Creates strategic frameworks

3. **Content Agent** (`contentAgent.js`)
   - Generates professional application emails
   - Creates detailed application memos
   - Ensures content aligns with strategy
   - Maintains appropriate tone and formality

4. **QA Agent** (`qaAgent.js`)
   - Reviews generated materials for quality
   - Provides quality scores and analysis
   - Suggests improvements
   - Ensures alignment with requirements

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- OpenAI API key

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd MCP_JobApplication
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Create environment file:
   - Create a new file `.env` in the `frontend` directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guide

1. **Upload Resume**
   - Click "Upload Resume" button
   - Select a PDF or text file containing your resume
   - The system will automatically parse and structure your resume data
   - Parsed data is stored locally for future use

2. **Enter Job Details**
   - Paste the job description in the provided field
   - Add company description/information
   - The parsed resume context will be automatically loaded if previously saved

3. **Generate Materials**
   - Click "Generate Application Materials"
   - The system will process through all AI agents:
     1. Context analysis
     2. Strategy development
     3. Content generation
     4. Quality assessment

4. **Review Output**
   - Generated email with subject line and body
   - Detailed application memo
   - Quality score and analysis
   - Strategic insights and recommendations

## Technical Details

### Key Dependencies
- React
- Material-UI
- OpenAI API
- PDF.js (for PDF parsing)
- Local Storage API

## Security Considerations

- The OpenAI API key is exposed in the frontend (for development purposes)
- In a production environment, API calls should be moved to a backend server
- Resume data is stored in the browser's localStorage
- File parsing is done client-side for better privacy

## Future Improvements

### Feedback Loop System
The system will be enhanced with a sophisticated feedback loop mechanism to continuously improve context understanding and output quality:

1. **Application Success Tracking**
   - Track which applications led to interviews/offers
   - Analyze successful application patterns
   - Store effective phrases and approaches
   - Build a database of successful strategies per industry/role

2. **Context Learning System**
   - Implement a context database to store:
     - Job description patterns
     - Company culture indicators
     - Industry-specific terminology
     - Successful matching strategies
   - Use ML to identify high-impact resume elements
   - Build industry-specific skill taxonomies

3. **Dynamic Prompt Enhancement**
   - Adjust agent prompts based on success rates
   - Fine-tune language models with successful examples
   - Develop industry-specific prompt templates
   - Implement A/B testing for different prompt strategies

4. **Quality Metrics Collection**
   - Response rates from applications
   - Interview conversion rates
   - Time-to-response metrics
   - Recruiter engagement analytics
   - Automated sentiment analysis of responses

5. **Adaptive Strategy System**
   - Machine learning models to:
     - Predict most effective approach per company
     - Suggest optimal content length
     - Recommend best highlighting strategies
     - Adjust tone based on company culture

6. **User Feedback Integration**
